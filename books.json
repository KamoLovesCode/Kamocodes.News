Bolt's job was to polish the city's central gear, a task he performed with diligence but little joy. One day, a strange, rhythmic clanking echoed from a forgotten alley. Curious, Bolt followed the sound and found an old, discarded music box. As he wound it up, a beautiful melody filled the air, a sound unlike any of the city's monotonous hums. The music made his circuits tingle with a new feeling. He shared his discovery with other robots, and soon, the rigid city was filled with dance, song, and the wonderful chaos of creativity.",
